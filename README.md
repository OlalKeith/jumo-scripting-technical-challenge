# jumo-scripting-technical-challenge
This is a scripting challenge using Bash.


##### 1. Create a script that determines the OS version. The script should then create a file task1.txt in the temporary directory (C:\Temp or tmp). The script should finally write the OS version into the file task1.txt.
- > First I created a folder and named it 'Jumotechnicalchallenge' :

*'mkdir Jumotechnicalchallenge'*

- > Created a filename and named it 'task1.sh'.Changed the permissions of the file and make it executable using chmod +x:

*chmod +x task1.sh*

##### 2. Create a script that identifies the current user and determines whether they have root/system permissions. If the user is privileged, determine whether the host has the file task2.txt in their temporary directory (C:\Temp or tmp). If the file exists, delete it, otherwise create it and add the machine name as an entry to the text file.
- > Inside the 'Jumotechnicalchallenge' folder :

- > Created a filename and named it 'task2.sh'.Changed the permissions of the file and make it executable using chmod +x:

*chmod +x task2.sh*

##### 3. Create a script that obtains the machine name. The script should then write out the machine name backwards and store it in task3.txt in the userâ€™s temporary directory (C:\Temp or tmp). You must use a loop to achieve this.
