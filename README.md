# jumo-scripting-technical-challenge
This is a scripting challenge using Bash.


##### 1. Create a script that determines the OS version. The script should then create a file task1.txt in the temporary directory (C:\Temp or tmp). The script should finally write the OS version into the file task1.txt.
- First I created a folder and named it 'Jumotechnicalchallenge' :

'mkdir Jumotechnicalchallenge'

- Created a filename and named it 'task1.sh'.Changed the permissions of the file and make it executable using chmod +x:

chmod +x task1.sh 



##### 2. Create a script that identifies the current user and determines whether they have root/system permissions. If the user is privileged, determine whether the host has the file task2.txt in their temporary directory (C:\Temp or tmp). If the file exists, delete it, otherwise create it and add the machine name as an entry to the text file.
- Inside the 'Jumotechnicalchallenge' folder :

- Created a filename and named it 'task2.sh'.Changed the permissions of the file and make it executable using chmod +x:

chmod +x task2.sh
